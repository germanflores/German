Today I received a meeting request that did not convince me that I should attend. This is how I responded before accepting the meeting:

Could you help me understand why we need to meet? The title of the meeting does not help me

* What questions do you have?
* Why do we need to meet?
* What problem are we meeting to solve?
* How should I prepare for this conversation?
* What is the agenda?
* What decision are we meeting to make?
