In the Leapfrog Technology Team, we use the Scrum framework method to deliver software. The Scrum framework has an artifact called “Stories” sometimes also referred to as “User Stories” too. Stories represent work, the “what” and the “why.”

## We Write Stories
* To articulate and communicate requests for work
* To be transparent about what we are working on
* To ensure people asking the work and people doing the work are aligned
* As a placeholder for people to have conversations
* To mitigate building the wrong _thing_
* To break work down into deliverable pieces and identify dependencies
* To have discipline around capturing the _what_ and _why_
* Self-discipline. Don’t take on too much. Deliver one thing at a time
* So the team is aligned with the work and help in case someone is sick
* Keep track and understand how much effort we are spending on initiatives
* Define what the team will deliver every two weeks
* To have useful Stands aligned on stories the team is working on
* To reflect on the work we produced in team Retrospectives

## We Do Not Write Stories

* For when having a conversation and agreement is faster and easier than writing a story
* For process sake
* Because Workfront is fun to use
* To compete with other teams
* To show managers we are busy
* To manage people
