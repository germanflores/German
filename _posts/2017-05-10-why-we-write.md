<p>In the Leapfrog Technology Team, we use the Scrum framework method to deliver software. The Scrum framework has an artifact called “Stories” sometimes also referred to as “User Stories” too. Stories represent work, the “what” and the “why.”</p>

<p>n  </p>
<li>Self-discipline. Don’t take on too much. Deliver one thing at a time</li>

<p>n</ul>

<h2 id="we-do-not-write-stories">We Do Not Write Stories</h2>
<p>n</p>
<ul>n  </p>
<li>For when having a conversation and agreement is faster and easier than writing a story</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>For process sake</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>Because Workfront is fun to use</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>To compete with other teams</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>To show managers we are busy</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>To manage people</li>
<p>n</ul>
