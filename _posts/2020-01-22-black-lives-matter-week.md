<img src="/assets/images/2020-01-22-lake-michigan.jpeg" />

My kids elementary school is doing a Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action next week, topics for the week are

* What is Black Lives Matter Week?
* Restorative Justice, Empathy & Loving Engagement
* Diversity & Globalism
* Queer, Trans-Affirming & Collective Value
* Intergenerational, Black families & Black villages
* Black Women & Unapologetically Black

↑ Topics for K-2 grades. I’m sharing because it is encouraging to see these conversations happening in a school environment.
