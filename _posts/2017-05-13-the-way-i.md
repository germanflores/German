<p>The last few years in the Scrum Master role my perspective about Scrum related words has changed. Here are a few words that I’m trying to change in my vocabulary when I’m teaching others about Agile philosophies and the Scrum framework.</p>
<p>nn</p>
<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>
<p>n</p>
<p>Instead of Sprint I prefer <em>iteration</em>. Sounds and reads more sustainable. Teams iterate on work every two weeks.</p>
<p>nn</p>
<h2 id="forecasting">Forecasting</h2>
<p>n</p>
<p>Instead of Planning I prefer <em>forecasting</em>. Sounds realistic. The team forecast work they believe they can deliver over the next two weeks. Things change, a forecast changes.</p>
<p>nn</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>n</p>
<p>Instead of rituals, e.g. Scrum rituals I prefer <em>Team Meetings</em>. Ritual sounds too religious, cultish.</p>
<p>nn</p>
<h2 id="sustainable">Sustainable</h2>
<p>n</p>
<p>When a team is in a bad situation I ask myself, is this sustainable.</p>
<p>nn</p>
<h2 id="backlog-refinement">Backlog Refinement</h2>
<p>n</p>
<p>Instead Backlog Grooming I’ve been using <em>Backlog Refinement</em> and <em>Backlog Discovery</em>. Every week the team refines the backlog or they discover and ideate about features or problems that exist at the Epic level.</p>
