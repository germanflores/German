The last few years in the Scrum Master role my perspective about Scrum related words has changed. Here are a few words that I’m trying to change in my vocabulary when I’m teaching others about Agile philosophies and the Scrum framework.

## Iteration
Instead of Sprint I prefer *iteration*. Sounds and reads more sustainable. Teams iterate on work every two weeks.

## Forecasting
Instead of Planning I prefer *forecasting*. Sounds realistic. The team forecast work they believe they can deliver over the next two weeks. Things change, a forecast changes.

## Meetings
Instead of rituals, e.g. Scrum rituals I prefer *Team Meetings*. Ritual sounds too religious, cultish.

## Sustainable
When a team is in a bad situation I ask myself, is this sustainable.

## Backlog Refinement
Instead Backlog Grooming I've been using *Backlog Refinement* and *Backlog Discovery*. Every week the team refines the backlog or they discover and ideate about features or problems that exist at the Epic level.
