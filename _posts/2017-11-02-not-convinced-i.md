<p>Today I received a meeting request that did not convince me that I should attend. This is how I responded before accepting the meeting:</p>
<p>nn</p>
<p>Could you help me understand why we need to meet? The title of the meeting does not help me</p>
<p>nn</p>
<ul>n  </p>
<li>What questions do you have?</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>Why do we need to meet?</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>What problem are we meeting to solve?</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>How should I prepare for this conversation?</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>What is the agenda?</li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>What decision are we meeting to make?</li>
<p>n</ul>
<p>n</p>
