The current situation for non-white people in our country is deplorable. Non-white people face inequality in many fundamental ways, in our justice system, in the continued harassment by the police, and in access to opportunities.

Our black employees are probably not surprised by the killings and the systemic racism because they have experienced it through their lives.

Black people, you are loved.

Our management should consider acknowledging the inequitable choices our country continues to make towards nonwhite people. In addition, if management feels compeled to do something beyond acknowledgement they can espouse how we as an organization treat our employees equitably with policies and facts.
