We have all experienced changes in the last six months. Captain Obvious speaking to you here. Some of us are rolling with it and some of us feel overwhelmed, tired of the change, longing for the past.

Now we have to wear masks, mind who we socialize with, no in-person events, no destination vacations, more talk about diversity, equality, politics, policing, un-employment.

If the list of changes is wearing you down, the intention of this post is to help you.

Here are some mindsets I’m trying to cultivate during these times.

### What Can I Control?

Sometimes it feels I cannot control anything, but if I look hard enough, I do have control over a few things.

* Keeping a positive attitude in the face of uncertainty
* Being nice to people
* Helping my kids prepare for the school year/day
* Keeping a constant connection with my family via weekly family calls
* Helping relatives that need help during these times

### One Day at a Time

Some days, it is best to focus on just what’s infant of me and don’t let the week ahead overwhelm me.

* Prepare for the meetings of the day and the kids schedule
* Make a list for the day and get the essential things done
* If I can, take a day-off to rest and catch-up

### Plan for the Future

I look ahead, dream a bit.

* Plan for that vacation, mini-trip, or weekend meal
* I’ve set up for my winter bicycling equipment and schedule
* Planning some home projects around the house, learning about hardwood flooring installation

### Doing Something About It

Sometimes I feel that I’m in it for the ride, that I have no agency. If I can, I do something about it.

* I’ve been contributing to my organizations inclusion, diversity, equity, and accountability team (IDEA) to help others
* I’ve been getting the word out on voting with my family, friends, and neighbors (by the way are you registered to vote, got your mail-in ballot, or are you set up for early voting?)
* Donated to organizations doing work for the causes that I care about

### Feeling Useful

Who can I help directly, how can I be of value?

* Supporting the teams at work to best of my ability
* Helping my family
* Helping my neighbors
* Reaching out to friends and acquaintances to say hi
