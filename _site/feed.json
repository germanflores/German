I had them use sticky notes to list the skills that they used in the past few sprints that saved their bacon or made big jobs easy. They held onto these. Then on a different color, list the skills they wish they had because it might have made their lives easier. They put their names on all their cards. Then they posted them on a white board, “have” side and “want” side.  At the end, they looked for needs that they could fill in their teammates, and scheduled pair programming and lunch-n-learn sessions to teach each other, and adjourned. They said the following few weeks they learned more than prior several months and it helped them all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
