Some of us are rolling with it and some of us feel overwhelmed, tired of the change, longing for the past.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have to wear masks, mind who we socialize with, no in-person events, no destination vacations, more talk about diversity, equality, politics, policing, un-employment.</p>\n\n<p>If the list of changes is wearing you down, the intention of this post is to help you.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some mindsets I’m trying to cultivate during these times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-can-i-control\">What Can I Control?</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes it feels I cannot control anything, but if I look hard enough, I do have control over a few things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Keeping a positive attitude in the face of uncertainty</li>\n  <li>Being nice to people</li>\n  <li>Helping my kids prepare for the school year/day</li>\n  <li>Keeping a constant connection with my family via weekly family calls</li>\n  <li>Helping relatives that need help during these times</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-day-at-a-time\">One Day at a Time</h3>\n\n<p>Some days, it is best to focus on just what’s infant of me and don’t let the week ahead overwhelm me.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Prepare for the meetings of the day and the kids schedule</li>\n  <li>Make a list for the day and get the essential things done</li>\n  <li>If I can, take a day-off to rest and catch-up</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"plan-for-the-future\">Plan for the Future</h3>\n\n<p>I look ahead, dream a bit.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Plan for that vacation, mini-trip, or weekend meal</li>\n  <li>I’ve set up for my winter bicycling equipment and schedule</li>\n  <li>Planning some home projects around the house, learning about hardwood flooring installation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"doing-something-about-it\">Doing Something About It</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes I feel that I’m in it for the ride, that I have no agency. If I can, I do something about it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I’ve been contributing to my organizations inclusion, diversity, equity, and accountability team (IDEA) to help others</li>\n  <li>I’ve been getting the word out on voting with my family, friends, and neighbors (by the way are you registered to vote, got your mail-in ballot, or are you set up for early voting?)</li>\n  <li>Donated to organizations doing work for the causes that I care about</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"feeling-useful\">Feeling Useful</h3>\n\n<p>Who can I help directly, how can I be of value?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Supporting the teams at work to best of my ability</li>\n  <li>Helping my family</li>\n  <li>Helping my neighbors</li>\n  <li>Reaching out to friends and acquaintances to say hi</li>\n</ul>\n",
